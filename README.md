![](images/AboutthisMac.png)

##**It is strongly recommended you use OpenCore, as Clover is slowly losing support.**

## Hardware Compatibility
Clover and OpenCore might work with Zenbook models under UX333, but it's **not recommended.**     
Specifically geared towards Zenbooks with Coffee Lake laptop processors.

## Software Compatibility
As of now, works with Mojave and above. **Big Sur may not work for the Clover build**

### OpenCore Support
Added, but trackpad is not working yet.

DSDT EFI will work but without battery monitoring and Fn Keys.
