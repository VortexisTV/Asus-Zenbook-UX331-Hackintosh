![](images/AboutthisMac.png)

## Hardware Compatibility
Clover and OpenCore might work with Zenbook models under UX333, but it's **not recommended.**     
Specifically geared towards Zenbooks with Coffee Lake laptop processors.

## Software Compatibility
As of now, works with Mojave and Catalina. *Big Sur will be added soon.*

### OpenCore Support (buggy)
Added, but trackpad, and Fn keys are not working yet. At times will freeze after login.

DSDT EFI will work but without battery monitoring.
